a fork is a copy of a repository. 
Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes 
without affecting the original project.

git commands 

to stage files for commit: 
1) git add filename.experiment
2) git add . ( for all the changes to be staged)

3) git commit -m "message" (commit to the local repo. you are ahead of the remote repo, therefore, you need a push)
4) git push
